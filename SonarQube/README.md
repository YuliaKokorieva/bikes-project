## SonarQube static code analysis

SonarQube is an open source platform to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells and security vulnerabilities on 25+ programming languages. 

In this app, the possibility to run static code analysis is implemented. 

Steps needed to be performed in order to run the analysis are described in the [Frontend README](https://github.com/YuliaKokorieva/bikes-project/blob/master/BikeRidesFront/README.md#setting-up-sonarqube-and-running-static-code-analysis).
